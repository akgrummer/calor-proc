\abstract{
The endcap calorimeters of CMS will be upgraded to a single High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) for the HL-LHC, including both silicon sensors and scintillator tiles with on-tile SiPMs as active elements. The readout of the active elements is performed by an ASIC (HGCROC in 130~nm CMOS technology) that measures the amplitude and arrival time of the signals. The amplitude is measured over a large dynamic range to allow calibration with single particles and the measurement of TeV showers. The time of arrival of high-energy showers will be measured with a precision of around 30 ps. A second pair of ``concentrator'' ASICs - ECON-T and ECON-D - takes the data from the HGCROC channels and packages them for transmission via optical links to the off-detector electronics. The ECON-T transmits trigger data at 40 MHz, to form part of the level-1 trigger. The ECON-D transmits concentrated data packets at up to 1 MHz, upon reception of a level-1 trigger signal. In addition to these ASICs HGCAL will use modified versions of common HL-LHC electronics developments, for the power chain and the optical control/readout. The dense nature of the HGCAL provides additional challenges for the electronic boards and cabling. In this proceedings the overall HGCAL front electronics scheme, including the latest performance of the HGCROC and ECON ASICs is presented.

\section{Introduction: HGCal front-end}
\label{intro}
Motivation and technical details of the HGCAL upgrade for operation in HL-LHC may be found in~\cite{CMS:HGCALTDR}.
This proceedings provides an overview of the HGCal frontend. The frontend electronics are used to (1) digitize the signal from the sensors with the HGCal Readout Chip (HGCROC), (2) perform data concentration with the E-link Concentrators (ECON) and (3) to transmit the data using the low power gigabit transceiver (lpGBT) and electrical to optical conversion (VTRX+). Plans for the implementation of the powering and services to the frontend will also be covered.
